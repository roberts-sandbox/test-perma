This is a test post made using the Jekyll system on GitHub. The text of this post is written in [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a surprisingly lightweight markup language.

Testing some Markdown features:
* List item 1
     * Subitem 1
	 * *Subitem 2 with emphasis*
* List item 2 with **strong emphasis**

Inline code is embedded using backticks (``). The C code `printf("Hello, world!")` prints "Hello, world!" to output. Additionally, longer code may be inserted using indents:
     #include <stdio.h>
	 int main(){
		printf("Hello, world!");
		return 0;
	 }

Quite fascinating.
